Core:
-Player 2 being recognized as Player 3 on Jamie's PC, UI lockout
    -Could have been windows-side weirdness due to big picture / steam link / controller unplug + replug
    -Indicative of a larger problem, OS-side controller indices should not matter
    -Players should be assigned an index when they log in, ex. hardware controller #3 should be able to act as game controller #0
    -XInput is limited to a max of 4 controllers
    -Modify framework code to self-manage player controller with GameInstance indices, rework UI for 2 max active players
    -4 player gameplay is a nice idea (tag, two per side, etc) but muddies the core concept
        -Tekken Tag is its own series for a reason

Lobby:
-Network clients can't esc back to title
-Esc does nothing if game viewport has focus
-Can't restore focus in lobby with keyboard/gamepad after clicking

Battle:
-Caster can activate two patterns at the same time if buttons are pressed on the same frame
-Clash damage applied when players switched via different lanes
-Players without valid profiles (a.k.a. local versions of remote players) are having their profile save method invoked when the match ends

Netcode:
-Spectating clients miss post-login match phase
-Replays miss post-login and match complete phases
-Match state may break if client does not receive update packets (unsure if still an issue now Force Net Update is implemented)
